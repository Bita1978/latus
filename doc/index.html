    <h1>Latus (<a href="http://www.lat.us">lat.us</a>) - Making Cloud Storage
      Services Secure for Personal Files</h1>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    Many people use cloud storage services such as Dropbox, iCloud, Microsoft's
    One Drive, etc. for their personal file syncing needs.&nbsp; While these
    services are quite convenient, there is still the risk of having your files
    'exposed' if there would happen to be a security flaw or hack.&nbsp; Many
    personal files are 'sensitive' in nature, such as financial records.&nbsp;
    Even though these services claim to be secure, there have certainly been
    many data 'breaches', especially recently.&nbsp; Even large corporations
    have fallen prey to these attacks and it seems that no entity is
    immune.&nbsp; Also, 'phishing' attacks can expose data in an otherwise
    secure system.&nbsp; An additional level of security is needed to ensure it
    is safe to use these cloud storage and syncing services for your sensitive
    files.<br>
    <h2>Technique</h2>
    Latus encrypts your files before sending them to the syncing folders that
    are used by your cloud storage provider.&nbsp; A parallel latus folder is
    created where your files are stored in their normal (unencrypted)
    state.&nbsp; The latus application monitors the latus folder.&nbsp; When a
    new or modified file is detected it is encrypted and copied to a special
    .latus cache folder (that users generally do not use) in the cloud storage
    folder.&nbsp; The diagram below shows this:<br>

    <br>
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    Latus is an open source Python application that encrypts your files before
    they are sent to your cloud storage provider.&nbsp; It is available at <a href="https://github.com/latusrepo/latus">https://github.com/latusrepo/latus</a>
    .<br>
    <h2>Competitors and Related Work</h2>
    Keepass is an open source password management application.&nbsp; It encrypts
    passwords before storing them in a local database file.&nbsp; It only does
    password (and associated comments), however.<br>
