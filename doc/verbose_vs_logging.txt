verbose vs. log level settings
------------------------------

verbose is intended for user interaction.  For example, if a user wants
to see what the program is doing step by step, verbose can be used.
A common usage is for the user to 'debug' their parameters and make sure
they are using the application properly.

log level settings are intended for developers.  The most common usages
are for debug of coding errors and/or collect runtime statistics.
This is especially handy in situations where developers can't modify the
source code on the fly for some reason (e.g. they only have executables,
or they don't readily have a way to modify the source).  Generally, users should 
not see log messages unless there are program bugs that cause the program
to malfunction in some way (programs should not merely silently crash - the
user should be alterted in some way).
