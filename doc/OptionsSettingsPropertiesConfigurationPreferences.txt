I'm going with the term 'settings'.  It could also be 'preferences'.

Reference (this seems as good of a defintion as any):

Following an approximate lead from Visual Studio and other Microsoft products:

Properties represent the characteristics of a single component or object in the application.

Options alter global ways that the application works. Microsoft products use this to customise the UI toolbar, 
for example. There's an implication here that you can disable UI elements altogether (e.g. a "Simple" user interface or an "Advanced" user interface).

Settings and Preferences change qualities of how the application works. The implication here is to change, not disable: for example, "Metric measurements" or "British Imperial measurements".

Configuration is often where an application is customised for each user or group.
