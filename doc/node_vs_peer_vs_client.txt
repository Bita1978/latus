Latus instances, esp. for sync, have the ability to communicate
with each other.  The question is: what to call these.

We'll call a latus instance a 'node'.  This is fairly generic, but
seems to fit OK.

Alternatives that were considered were 'peer' and 'client'.
These were rejected since this is not a pure P2P network nor 
does it have a pure client/server relationship.
